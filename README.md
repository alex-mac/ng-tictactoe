#Tic Tac Toe

##Objectives

* Build a tic tac toe game in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
* Use best practices when writing code

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository.
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Before you even start working with JavaScript, construct the gameboard. The gameboard page should include the 3x3 grid (of divs), and at minimum a reset button. Using `id` and `class` on clickable elements will help you wire this up in JavaScript afterwards.
* The JavaScript portion will be next
  * Select elements and attach functions via event listeners
  * You will also need a variable to keep track of moves. This will be used to indicate whether or not to draw an `X` or an `O`

##Requirements
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
* Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`
* Upon marking of an individual cell, use JavaScript to add a class to each cell to display separate colors.
* A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.

##Bonuses

* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
* After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row.
  * Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move.
* Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. Note that randomly selecting a space would count as "simple". Try that and iterate from there.
